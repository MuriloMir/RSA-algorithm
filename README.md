# RSA-algorithm
This is a code written in D which implements the RSA algorithm for cryptography.
This implementation is almost complete, I had to use smaller number for the sake of computational time, but it is very close to the official way to implement a safe RSA.
You may use this code as a guide when you are learning or when you try to implement your own version.
If you want to run it then just compile it with the DMD compiler.
